    <h1>A millennial surfing the web</h1>
        <p>My interest in programming began during the arrival of Myspace.com while I certainly did not code to create my profile page, I felt like I was a hacker when I was adding animations to the background of my page and adding music and choosing a profile page.</p>
        <p>My time on Myspace was divided with video games and burning cd's of my favorite artist. When cd's were losing popularity in favor of sites like Napster, I had to learn how that operated as well. I am fortunate to have grown up in a time where dial-up connections were the standard method of getting online, so when I was finally connected, I appreciated all the things that my computer could do.</p>
